![](https://miro.medium.com/0*OaxlzeHQGRlJzzbl.png)

So maybe youre running some program that takes some time to run, and want to take a nap or something. You probably need a simple script to send you an update when your program finishes running. We can easily write a Python function that sends you a Telegram message whenever you call it.

## 3 Simple Steps

1. Create a Telegram Bot using Telegrams BotFather

2. Getting your chat ID

3. Sending your Telegram message using Python

## 1. Create A Telegram Bot Using Telegrams BotFather

1. Open your telegram app and search for _BotFather. (A built-in Telegram bot that helps users create custom Telegram bots)_

2. Type `ewbot` to create a new bot

3. Give your bot a name & a username

4. Copy your new Telegram bots _token_

Note: dont upload your token online, as anyone with your token has full control of your Telegram bot.

## 2. Getting your chat ID

In Telegram, every chat has a chat ID, and we need this chat ID to send Telegram messages using Python.

1. Send your Telegram bot a message (any random message)

2. Run this Python script to find your chat ID

```
import requests
```

```
TOKEN = "YOUR TELEGRAM BOT TOKEN"
url = f"https://api.telegram.org/botTOKEN/getUpdates"
```

```
print(requests.get(url).json())
```

This script calls the `getUpdates` function, which kinda checks for new messages. We can find our chat ID from the returned JSON _(the one in red)_

Note: if you dont send your Telegram bot a message, your results might be empty.

3. Copy and paste the chat ID into our next step

## 3. Sending your Telegram message using Python

Copy and paste 1) your Telegram bot token and 2) your chat ID from the previous 2 steps into the following Python script. _(And do customize your message too)_

```
import requests
```

```
TOKEN = "YOUR TELEGRAM BOT TOKEN"
chat_id = "YOUR CHAT ID"
```

```
message = "hello from your telegram bot"
```

```
url = f"https://api.telegram.org/botTOKEN/sendMessage?chat_id=chat_id&text=message"
```

```
print(requests.get(url).json()) # this sends the message
```

Run the Python script and check your Telegram!
